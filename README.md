Stock Market Price Prediction (Python 3, Keras, Scikit Learn)
·	Developed an ML model to predict a change in stock price using LSTM, back propagation and 
                 SVM algorithms by compiling data from yahoo finance (January 2010 to December 2016)
·	Calculated metrics to aid the prediction: Index Momentum, Stock Price Volatility, Sector Momentum and Stock Momentum
·	Achieved an accuracy of 62% for Backpropagation and SVM and an accuracy of 73% for LSTM, 
·	Achieved T-test value of +-1.701, precision of 79% and a Standard Deviation of 1.36 which is acceptable for stock
                  market datasets because of high volatility in market trends.
